For this assignment we were tasked to write a C++ class for a map class that made use of abstract data types (ADT). 
The data structure that represents the map uses an array of elements that are allocated when the map is constructed. 
No existing facilities from the STL are used.
The map class was implemented to use as many data types as possible, including custom classes.
